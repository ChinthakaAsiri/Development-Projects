University of Kelaniya - COSC 32035
--The Problem--
* No proper drug management and distribution system available in Sri Lanka
* Hospitals use a log book to maintain the records 
* No drug estimation was made, hence drug shortages and surplus 
* Hence, public fund wastage

--Research--
* Consulted government hospital doctors and staff and got an idea about the current process

--Solution--
* Develop a software system containing two ends. Only selected users can access to the system
* Main - The system that feeds data about the drug distribution 
* Client - The system that has access to the local hospitals. They have to update their system regularly. 

--Techniques Used--
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* SQL Server Management Studio
* SQL Server 2008 R2

--Further Development--
* Develop an app for doctors and ask them to provide e-prescription by login seperate app. Link it with the hospital app and reduce the drug quantity based on the doctor's prescription
* Automate the drug ordering system to the hospitals
* Predict the drug shortages and automatically make orders
